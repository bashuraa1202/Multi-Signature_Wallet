# Multi-Signature_Wallet

This is a fourth-year university group project repository. In this project, we attempt to deliver a multi-signature Ethereum wallet that produces a compact signature for storing on the blockchain, as well as consuming less gas to validate and execute transactions. We did not need to know anything about blockchain or Web3 before starting as the professor gave us lectures going over the fundamentals. All we needed was a passion for learning.
